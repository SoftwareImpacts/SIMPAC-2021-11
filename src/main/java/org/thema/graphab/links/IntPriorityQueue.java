/**
 * An unbounded priority {@linkplain Queue queue} based on a priority heap.
 * The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their
 * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering}, or by a {@link Comparator}
 * provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is
 * used.  A priority queue does not permit {@code null} elements.
 * A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit
 * insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in
 * {@code ClassCastException}).
 *
 * <p>The <em>head</em> of this queue is the <em>least</em> element
 * with respect to the specified ordering.  If multiple elements are
 * tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are
 * broken arbitrarily.  The queue retrieval operations {@code poll},
 * {@code remove}, {@code peek}, and {@code element} access the
 * element at the head of the queue.
 *
 * <p>A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal
 * <i>capacity</i> governing the size of an array used to store the
 * elements on the queue.  It is always at least as large as the queue
 * size.  As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity
 * grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
 * specified.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
 * Iterator} interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method {@link
 * #iterator()} is <em>not</em> guaranteed to traverse the elements of
 * the priority queue in any particular order. If you need ordered
 * traversal, consider using {@code Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())}.
 *
 * <p> <strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * Multiple threads should not access a {@code PriorityQueue}
 * instance concurrently if any of the threads modifies the queue.
 * Instead, use the thread-safe {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue} class.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: this implementation provides
 * O(log(n)) time for the enqueing and dequeing methods
 * ({@code offer}, {@code poll}, {@code remove()} and {@code add});
 * linear time for the {@code remove(Object)} and {@code contains(Object)}
 * methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods
 * ({@code peek}, {@code element}, and {@code size}).
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
